# AI Interviewer Agent - Frontend Update Plan

## Project Understanding

Before diving into the implementation plan, it's essential to understand the core agent system that powers the AI Interviewer Agent. This understanding will inform our frontend design decisions and ensure proper integration with the backend.

### Agent System Overview

The AI Interviewer Agent uses a multi-agent architecture with specialized components that work together to provide a comprehensive interview preparation experience:

1. **Interviewer Agent**
   - **Primary Role**: Conducts interview sessions by asking questions, evaluating answers, and managing the interview flow
   - **Key Features**:
     - Implements a state machine (initializing → introduction → questioning → follow-up → summarizing → ended)
     - Generates tailored questions based on job role and requirements
     - Adapts questioning based on previous answers
     - Supports different interview styles (formal, conversational, etc.)
     - Evaluates answer quality using structured metrics
     - Provides comprehensive interview summaries

2. **Coach Agent**
   - **Primary Role**: Provides constructive feedback, guidance, and improvement suggestions
   - **Key Features**:
     - Evaluates responses using the STAR method framework
     - Assesses communication skills and response completeness
     - Provides real-time or summary feedback
     - Generates practice questions with structured guidance
     - Identifies strengths and areas for improvement
     - Offers personalized coaching plans based on performance

3. **Skill Assessor Agent**
   - **Primary Role**: Identifies skill gaps and strengths based on interview performance
   - **Key Features**:
     - Extracts skills mentioned or demonstrated in responses
     - Assesses proficiency levels for identified skills
     - Categorizes skills by type (technical, soft, domain, etc.)
     - Recommends learning resources for skill improvement
     - Generates comprehensive skill profiles
     - Tracks skill development across multiple sessions

4. **Orchestrator**
   - **Primary Role**: Coordinates communication between agents and manages the overall interview flow
   - **Key Features**:
     - Routes user input to appropriate agents
     - Aggregates responses from multiple agents
     - Maintains session state and context
     - Handles mode transitions (interview → coaching → skill assessment)
     - Manages the event bus for agent communication

### Agent Communication

Agents communicate through an event-based system using an Event Bus:
- Agents publish events when they generate content or need to share information
- Other agents subscribe to relevant events and react accordingly
- The Orchestrator manages the flow of events and coordinates agent activities

### User Interaction Flow

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - User provides job role, description, and optionally resume
   - System configures the agents based on this context

2. **Interview Session**:
   - Interviewer Agent conducts the interview with adaptive questioning
   - User responds to questions via speech or text
   - Responses are evaluated in real-time

3. **Coaching and Feedback**:
   - Coach Agent provides feedback on interview responses
   - Highlights strengths and areas for improvement
   - Offers structured guidance for better responses

4. **Skill Assessment**:
   - Skill Assessor analyzes responses to identify skills
   - Evaluates proficiency levels for each skill
   - Recommends resources for improving skill gaps

5. **Summary and Resources**:
   - System generates comprehensive interview summary
   - Provides skill profile with proficiency levels
   - Offers tailored learning resources for improvement

Understanding this multi-agent architecture is crucial for designing a frontend that effectively showcases each agent's capabilities while providing a seamless user experience.
