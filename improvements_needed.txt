At the start of the interview, the interviewer starts off twice, I should make it only introduce once, such that its not awkward for the interviewee.

Towards the end, the interviewer seems to abruptly cut the interview, it should give some sort of conclusion like, good to chat with you, we'll discuss with the team and inform you of our decision.
Skill assessor and coach agents can be improved.
add tools for agents to work with


#Todo:
1. Check and remove root - main.py
2. Check and remove backend/tests/ ✅
3. explore config.py 
4. Remove openAPI.json ✅
5. backend/services/__init__.py seems to be very important, should we move it somewhere else
- initialize_services() seems to be important as it initializes a lot of functions from utils and services.
8. Remove target_question_count, the agent dynamically decides and finishes the interview or atleast make the target count not strict
The generic questions are used to fill the gap between job_specific_questions and target_question_count.. so deal with it
Done:
9. the interviewer agent should mainly ask questions based on the job description 
10. is there a need for new_topics_covered in interviewer agent
10. coach coaches on each pair and can incorporate the justification given by the interviwer agent for its response ✅
11. Add a proper database and let users store their data and details. 
12. Add feature for user to talk with the coach and seek advice on how to improve and this can be where the tools are existing. 
Done 
- Removed document_generator file and its references from the codebase 
- Removed tests folder




NEW:
- remove mock_db_manager, run-with-mock-auth and their coressponding references in auth_api.py and services.__init__.py
