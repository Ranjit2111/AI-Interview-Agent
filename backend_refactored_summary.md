# Backend Refactoring Summary

## 1. Overall Goal

The primary goal of this refactoring was to significantly overhaul the feedback and assessment capabilities of the AI Interviewer system. This involved:

*   **Deleting the `SkillAssessorAgent`**: This agent and its associated functionality (skill profiling, skill-based feedback) were entirely removed from the system.
*   **Completely Overhauling the `CoachAgent`**: The `CoachAgent` was repurposed to become the sole provider of detailed, actionable feedback. It now:
    *   Receives more contextual information at initialization (resume, job description) and per Q&A cycle (question, answer, interviewer's justification for the next question, conversation history).
    *   Provides granular feedback on each answer across dimensions like conciseness, completeness, technical accuracy, contextual alignment, and offers specific fixes.
    *   Generates a comprehensive final summary at the end of the interview, including observed patterns, strengths, weaknesses (with causes), and areas for improvement.
    *   Identifies topics for resource recommendations, which are then (conceptually, and simulated in the orchestrator) fetched via a web search tool and included in the final summary.
*   **Streamlining Agent Interactions**: The `AgentSessionManager` (orchestrator) was updated to manage the new interaction flow with the revamped `CoachAgent` and the `InterviewerAgent`.
*   **Updating Data Schemas and API Endpoints**: Necessary changes were made to API request/response models and internal data structures to support the new information flow (e.g., passing resume/JD at the start, returning rich coaching summaries).
*   **Cleaning up Event System**: Unused event types in the `EventBus` were removed to reflect the simplified agent interactions.

## 2. File-by-File Changes

### A. Deleted Files

1.  **`backend/agents/skill_assessor.py`**
    *   Entire file and `SkillAssessorAgent` class deleted.

2.  **`backend/agents/templates/skill_templates.py`**
    *   Entire file and associated prompt templates for the `SkillAssessorAgent` deleted.

3.  **`skill_assessor_documentation.txt`**
    *   Documentation file for the `SkillAssessorAgent` deleted.

4.  **`coach_documentation.txt`** (and potentially `interviewer_documentation.txt`)
    *   Specific documentation files for agents were removed as part of the refactoring, with the expectation that documentation would be consolidated or handled differently.

### B. Modified Files

1.  **`backend/agents/coach.py` (CoachAgent)**
    *   **`__init__` Method:**
        *   Modified to accept `resume_content: Optional[str]` and `job_description: Optional[str]`.
        *   Stores these in `self.resume_content` and `self.job_description`.
    *   **`evaluate_answer` Method (New Logic):**
        *   Signature: `evaluate_answer(self, question: str, answer: str, justification: Optional[str], conversation_history: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, str]`
        *   Takes the current question, user's answer, InterviewerAgent's justification for the *next* question, and conversation history.
        *   Uses an LLM chain (`self.evaluate_answer_chain`) with a new detailed prompt template (`EVALUATE_ANSWER_TEMPLATE`) to generate feedback.
        *   Expected output is a dictionary with keys like `conciseness`, `completeness`, `technical_accuracy_depth`, `contextual_alignment`, `fixes_improvements`, and optionally `star_support`.
    *   **`generate_final_summary` Method (New Logic):**
        *   Signature: `generate_final_summary(self, conversation_history: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]`
        *   Takes the full conversation history.
        *   Uses an LLM chain (`self.final_summary_chain`) with a new detailed prompt template (`FINAL_SUMMARY_TEMPLATE`).
        *   Expected output is a dictionary including `patterns_tendencies`, `strengths`, `weaknesses`, `improvement_focus_areas`, and crucially `resource_search_topics` (a list of strings).
        *   Initializes `parsed_summary["recommended_resources"] = []` if `resource_search_topics` exist, as a placeholder for the orchestrator/assistant to fill with actual search results.
    *   **`_setup_llm_chains` Method:**
        *   Updated to initialize `self.evaluate_answer_chain` and `self.final_summary_chain` with the new prompt templates from `coach_templates.py`.
    *   **`process` Method:**
        *   Kept minimal, noting that primary actions are driven by direct calls from the orchestrator.
    *   Removed old methods related to previous coaching logic.

2.  **`backend/agents/templates/coach_templates.py`**
    *   All previous template strings were deleted.
    *   Added new, detailed prompt templates:
        *   `EVALUATE_ANSWER_TEMPLATE`: Defines the structure and instructions for the LLM to evaluate a single answer based on resume, JD, history, Q-A pair, and interviewer justification.
        *   `FINAL_SUMMARY_TEMPLATE`: Defines the structure and instructions for the LLM to generate the overall interview summary, including strengths, weaknesses, patterns, and topics for resource recommendations.

3.  **`backend/agents/orchestrator.py` (AgentSessionManager)**
    *   **Imports:**
        *   Removed import of `SkillAssessorAgent`.
    *   **`_get_agent` Method:**
        *   Removed logic for instantiating `SkillAssessorAgent`.
        *   When instantiating `CoachAgent`, it now passes `resume_content=self.session_config.resume_content` and `job_description=self.session_config.job_description`.
    *   **`process_message` Method:**
        *   After `InterviewerAgent` generates its response (next question and metadata), the method now:
            *   Retrieves the `question_that_was_answered` by the user.
            *   Retrieves `justification` from the `InterviewerAgent`'s response metadata.
            *   Calls `coach_agent.evaluate_answer()` with `question`, `answer` (current user message), `justification`, and `conversation_history`.
            *   Packages the `coaching_feedback` (dictionary) from `CoachAgent` into a new message structure.
            *   Appends this coach feedback message to `self.conversation_history`.
            *   Publishes an `ASSISTANT_RESPONSE` event with `source='CoachAgent'` and the feedback message as data.
    *   **`end_interview` Method:**
        *   No longer attempts to generate or include a `skill_profile`.
        *   Calls `coach_agent.generate_final_summary(self.conversation_history)`.
        *   Stores the result in `final_results["coaching_summary"]`.
        *   If `coaching_summary` contains `resource_search_topics`:
            *   Iterates through these topics (simulating web searches).
            *   Hardcoded example search results for "effective communication in interviews" and "STAR method for behavioral questions" are used.
            *   Appends a list of `{"topic": topic, "resources": search_results_for_topic}` to `coaching_summary["recommended_resources"]`. Each `search_results_for_topic` is a list of dicts with `title`, `url`, `snippet`.
    *   **General:** Adjusted logging and event publishing to reflect changes.

4.  **`backend/utils/event_bus.py` (EventType)**
    *   The `EventType` enum was significantly cleaned up.
    *   **Removed Event Types:**
        *   `SKILL_ASSESSMENT`
        *   `SKILL_EXTRACTED`
        *   `INTERVIEWER_RESPONSE`
        *   `INTERVIEW_COMPLETED`
        *   `INTERVIEW_SUMMARY`
        *   `COACHING_REQUEST`
        *   `COACH_FEEDBACK`
        *   `COACH_ANALYSIS`
        *   `TRANSCRIPT_CREATED`
        *   `TRANSCRIPT_UPDATED`
        *   `TRANSCRIPT_DELETED`
        *   `SESSION_PERSISTED`
        *   `STATUS_UPDATE`
    *   **Kept Event Types:**
        *   `SESSION_START`
        *   `SESSION_END`
        *   `SESSION_RESET`
        *   `AGENT_LOAD`
        *   `USER_MESSAGE`
        *   `ASSISTANT_RESPONSE` (now used for both Interviewer and Coach messages)
        *   `ERROR`

5.  **`backend/schemas/session.py`**
    *   `SessionEndResponse` (or equivalent API response model for ending session):
        *   The `skill_profile: Optional[SkillProfile]` field was removed. The structure now accommodates the `coaching_summary` dictionary.
    *   (Implicitly) `InterviewStartRequest` or equivalent Pydantic model used by the API for starting a session was confirmed to correctly pass `job_description` and `resume_content`.

6.  **`backend/agents/templates/__init__.py`**
    *   Removed any exports related to the deleted `skill_templates.py`.

7.  **`backend/api/agent_api.py`**
    *   **`InterviewStartRequest` (Pydantic Model):**
        *   Confirmed fields `job_description: Optional[str]` and `resume_content: Optional[str]` are present to accept these inputs.
    *   **`/start` Endpoint (`start_interview` function):**
        *   Ensured it correctly uses `InterviewStartRequest` and passes the `job_description` and `resume_content` to the `AgentSessionManager`'s `session_config`.
    *   **`/message` Endpoint (`post_message` function):**
        *   The `AgentResponse` model's `content` field is `str`. The endpoint returns the InterviewerAgent's string response. Coach's dictionary feedback is sent via an event. This design was deemed acceptable.
    *   **`/end` Endpoint (`end_interview` function):**
        *   The `EndResponse` model (e.g., `results: Dict[str, Any]`) correctly accommodates the `coaching_summary` (which is a dictionary) returned by `AgentSessionManager.end_interview()`. It no longer expects or returns a `skill_profile`.
    *   Verified overall consistency with schema changes and new data flow.

8.  **`backend/agents/interviewer.py` (InterviewerAgent)**
    *   The primary change related to this agent was ensuring its `process` method's output dictionary includes a `justification` field within its `metadata`. This `justification` (for the next question or action) is then consumed by `AgentSessionManager` and passed to `CoachAgent.evaluate_answer()`.
    *   No major structural changes to the `InterviewerAgent` itself were required for this, as it was mostly about confirming the output contract.
    *   Reviewed event subscriptions (`SESSION_START`, `SESSION_END`, `SESSION_RESET`) which remain relevant for its internal state.

9.  **`backend/main.py`**
    *   Verified that `AgentSessionManager` is initialized correctly during application startup.
    *   Verified that API routes from `agent_api.py` are registered.
    *   No direct code changes were made to this file as part of the core refactoring logic, but its role in the setup was confirmed.

10. **`backend/agents/base.py` (BaseAgent, AgentContext)**
    *   Reviewed to ensure `AgentContext` and `BaseAgent` were compatible with the changes (e.g., `AgentContext` holding `session_config` which contains resume/JD). No changes were needed.
