# Test Checklist for Voice-First Interface Fixes

## Test Environment Setup
- ‚úÖ Backend server running on port 8000
- ‚úÖ Frontend development server running
- ‚úÖ Microphone access enabled in browser
- ‚úÖ Audio output working for TTS

## Test Case 1: Manual Start/Stop Control (Fix for Premature Sending)

### Expected Behavior
The microphone should only send transcribed text when the user manually stops recording, NOT when Deepgram detects pauses.

### Test Steps
1. **Start Interview Session**
   - Navigate to the interview configuration
   - Start a new interview
   - Observe the immersive voice-first interface

2. **Test Manual Mic Control**
   - Press the microphone button to start recording
   - ‚úÖ Verify: Blue glow appears around the mic button
   - ‚úÖ Verify: Status shows "Listening... Tap to stop"

3. **Speak with Deliberate Pauses**
   - Say: "Hello, my name is..." [pause 2-3 seconds] "...John Smith"
   - ‚úÖ Verify: Message is NOT sent during the pause
   - ‚úÖ Verify: Blue glow continues during the pause
   - ‚úÖ Verify: No transcript appears in the chat during speaking

4. **Manual Stop**
   - Press the microphone button again to stop recording
   - ‚úÖ Verify: Recording stops immediately
   - ‚úÖ Verify: Transcribed message appears in the chat
   - ‚úÖ Verify: Message content includes the full sentence with pause

### Success Criteria
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: If message is sent during the pause
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: If message is only sent when manually stopping the mic

## Test Case 2: Clean Interface (Fix for "Ugly Box")

### Expected Behavior
No unwanted UI elements, boxes, or notifications should appear during speech recording.

### Test Steps
1. **Start Recording**
   - Press the microphone button to start
   - Begin speaking clearly

2. **Look for Visual Distractions**
   - ‚úÖ Verify: No transcript preview boxes appear
   - ‚úÖ Verify: No "Building Answer" purple boxes
   - ‚úÖ Verify: No "Final transcript" green boxes  
   - ‚úÖ Verify: No "Speaking:" amber boxes
   - ‚úÖ Verify: No error toasts or notifications

3. **Test Empty Recording**
   - Press mic to start recording
   - Wait 2-3 seconds without speaking
   - Press mic to stop recording
   - ‚úÖ Verify: No "No Speech Detected" toast appears
   - ‚úÖ Verify: Interface remains clean

### Success Criteria
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: If any transcript boxes or unwanted notifications appear
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: If only the blue glow and status text are visible

## Test Case 3: Voice Activity Visual Feedback

### Expected Behavior
The blue glow should respond to voice activity without triggering premature sends.

### Test Steps
1. **Start Recording**
   - Press the microphone button

2. **Test Voice Activity Response**
   - Speak normally: ‚úÖ Verify blue glow intensifies
   - Pause speaking: ‚úÖ Verify blue glow dims but remains
   - Resume speaking: ‚úÖ Verify blue glow intensifies again
   - Stop manually: ‚úÖ Verify recording stops only on button press

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: Blue glow responds to voice but doesn't trigger sends

## Test Case 4: Complete Conversation Flow

### Expected Behavior
Full conversation should work with manual control and TTS responses.

### Test Steps
1. **First Exchange**
   - Record: "Hello, I'm excited to start this interview"
   - ‚úÖ Verify: Message sent only on manual stop
   - ‚úÖ Verify: AI responds with TTS audio
   - ‚úÖ Verify: Mic becomes available after TTS ends

2. **Second Exchange**
   - Record: "My background is in software development"
   - ‚úÖ Verify: Manual control works consistently
   - ‚úÖ Verify: No visual distractions during recording

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: Complete flow works with manual control

## Common Issues to Watch For

### ‚ùå Issues That Indicate Problems
- Messages sent during pauses in speech
- Purple/green/amber transcript boxes appearing
- "No Speech Detected" toasts showing up
- Microphone stopping automatically during pauses
- Visual elements appearing outside the main interface

### ‚úÖ Expected Behaviors
- Blue glow around mic during recording
- "Listening... Tap to stop" status text
- Manual control over when messages are sent
- Clean, immersive interface maintained
- TTS audio plays automatically for AI responses

## Browser Console Debugging

If issues occur, check the browser console for:
- `üìù Final transcript accumulated:` - Shows transcripts being collected
- `üìù Interim transcript:` - Shows real-time transcription
- `üì§ Sending accumulated transcript on manual stop:` - Confirms manual sending
- No unexpected error messages about speech recognition

## Performance Verification

### Expected Performance
- ‚úÖ Microphone responds immediately to button presses
- ‚úÖ Voice activity detection shows in real-time
- ‚úÖ TTS audio plays without delay
- ‚úÖ No lag between speaking and visual feedback

## If Tests Fail

### For Premature Sending Issues
1. Check browser console for unexpected "sending" messages
2. Verify Deepgram configuration in backend
3. Confirm manual mic button behavior

### For Visual Issues
1. Check for any remaining VoiceInputToggle components
2. Verify toast notifications are properly suppressed
3. Look for unexpected CSS overlays

### For Audio Issues
1. Verify microphone permissions
2. Check browser audio settings
3. Confirm TTS voice selection is working

## Success Summary

All tests should pass for the fixes to be considered complete:
- ‚úÖ Manual start/stop control working
- ‚úÖ No premature sending during pauses
- ‚úÖ Clean interface with no unwanted boxes
- ‚úÖ Voice activity feedback working properly
- ‚úÖ Complete conversation flow functional
