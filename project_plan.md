## Kokoro TTS Integration

We will use the Kokoro FastAPI implementation to provide high-quality Text-to-Speech capabilities. Key integration points include:

1. **Local Deployment**: Deploy Kokoro TTS as a containerized service using the provided Docker configuration
2. **Voice Selection**: Implement voice selection UI allowing users to choose from available voices
3. **Streaming Support**: Use the streaming API for real-time speech generation during interviews
4. **Word-level Timestamps**: Leverage captioned_speech endpoint for synchronized highlighting of spoken text
5. **Performance Optimization**: Configure appropriate chunking settings based on hardware constraints

Implementation will focus on the CPU version initially, with parameters tuned for the GTX 1650 GPU if performance issues arise.

## Agent Communication Pattern (Event Bus)

Based on the LlamaIndex and smolagents documentation, we'll implement:

1. **Event-driven Architecture**: Agents communicate via typed events published to the event bus
2. **Planning Intervals**: Incorporate planning steps where agents reflect on gathered information and plan next actions
3. **ReAct Pattern**: Use the Thought-Action-Observation pattern for structured agent reasoning
4. **Telemetry**: Implement instrumentation similar to LlamaIndex for debugging and monitoring agent behavior

This approach ensures agents can operate both independently and collaboratively while maintaining clear responsibility boundaries.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| ----------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Google Gemini API | Low        | Stay within rate limits (30 RPM, 15000 TPM, 14400 RPD), error handling |
| Web Search APIs   | Medium     | Support multiple providers, implement caching, create fallback search  |
| Local ML models   | High       | Optimize for limited RAM/VRAM (8GB RAM, 4GB VRAM GTX 1650)             |

## Success Criteria

1. All specified agents function correctly with appropriate specialization

6. User experience feels cohesive and intuitive

## Future Considerations

1. Multi-user support
2. Extended language model options
3. Additional interview domains beyond technical roles
