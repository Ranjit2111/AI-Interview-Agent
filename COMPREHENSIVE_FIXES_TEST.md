# Comprehensive Voice-First Interview Fixes Test Guide

## Issues Fixed in This Update

### ‚úÖ 1. WebSocket Connection Error
**Problem**: `TypeError: object NoneType can't be used in 'await' expression`
**Fix**: Made `ConnectionManager.disconnect()` method async
**Test**: Check backend logs for WebSocket errors during voice sessions

### ‚úÖ 2. Excessive Coach Feedback Polling  
**Problem**: Coach feedback API called every 2 seconds constantly
**Fix**: Only poll when there are pending user messages that need analysis
**Test**: Monitor backend logs - should only see polling after user responses

### ‚úÖ 3. Manual Mic Control Not Working
**Problem**: Microphone cutting off automatically during pauses
**Fix**: 
- Simplified transcript accumulation logic
- Increased Deepgram utterance_end_ms from 3000ms to 5000ms
- Only process final transcripts for accumulation
**Test**: Speak with pauses - mic should stay active until manual stop

### ‚úÖ 4. TTS Not Playing by Default
**Problem**: Interview agent responses not playing as audio
**Fix**:
- Force voice selection to 'Matthew' on component mount
- Added comprehensive logging for TTS debugging
- Fixed dependency issues in useEffect
**Test**: Agent responses should play automatically as audio

## Detailed Test Procedures

### Test 1: WebSocket Stability
1. Start an interview session
2. Begin voice recording 
3. Speak for 10-15 seconds
4. Stop recording manually
5. **Expected**: No WebSocket errors in backend logs
6. **Look for**: Clean connection/disconnection without errors

### Test 2: Coach Feedback Efficiency
1. Start interview and give first response
2. Monitor backend logs during and after response
3. **Expected**: Polling only starts after user message
4. **Expected**: Polling stops when feedback is received
5. **Look for**: No continuous polling every 2 seconds

### Test 3: Manual Microphone Control
1. Press microphone to start recording
2. Say: "My name is John..." [pause 3-4 seconds] "...and I work at Microsoft"
3. **Expected**: Recording continues during pause
4. **Expected**: No automatic message sending during pause
5. **Expected**: Message only sent when manually stopping mic
6. **Look for**: Console logs showing transcript accumulation

### Test 4: Automatic TTS Playback
1. Start interview session
2. **Expected**: Interviewer's opening question plays as audio immediately
3. Give a response and wait for agent reply
4. **Expected**: Agent response plays automatically as audio
5. **Look for**: Console logs showing "üîä TTS" messages

## Console Log Monitoring

### Success Indicators
```
üîä TTS enabled by default with Matthew voice
üîä TTS auto-play effect triggered. LastMessage: assistant undefined
üîä Auto-playing TTS for AI response: Thank you for joining me...
üîä Requesting TTS audio from API...
üîä Starting audio playback...
üîä Audio playback completed
üìù Final transcript accumulated: Hello
üì§ Sending accumulated transcript on manual stop: Hello, my name is John and I work at Microsoft
```

### Error Indicators to Watch For
```
‚ùå TypeError: object NoneType can't be used in 'await' expression
‚ùå Getting per-turn feedback for session... (every 2 seconds)
‚ùå ‚ö†Ô∏è No selectedVoice available for TTS
‚ùå Premature sending during pauses
```

## Backend Log Monitoring

### Expected Behavior
- WebSocket connections open/close cleanly
- Coach feedback polling only after user responses
- No TypeError exceptions
- TTS requests for each agent response

### Problem Indicators
- Continuous per-turn feedback requests every 2 seconds
- WebSocket NoneType errors
- Missing TTS requests for agent responses

## Manual Testing Workflow

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Backend (Terminal 1)
   cd backend && python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   
   # Frontend (Terminal 2) 
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Voice Test Sequence**
   - Configure interview normally
   - Start interview session
   - Verify opening question plays as audio ‚úÖ
   - Press mic button to start recording ‚úÖ
   - Speak with intentional pauses ‚úÖ
   - Verify no premature sending ‚úÖ
   - Press mic button to stop and send ‚úÖ
   - Verify agent response plays as audio ‚úÖ

3. **Backend Log Verification**
   - No continuous coach feedback polling ‚úÖ
   - No WebSocket TypeError exceptions ‚úÖ
   - Clean connection lifecycle ‚úÖ

## Expected Performance Improvements

- **Reduced Server Load**: Coach feedback polling only when needed
- **Better Voice Control**: Manual start/stop without interruptions
- **Improved User Experience**: Automatic TTS for all agent responses
- **Stable Connections**: No WebSocket errors disrupting sessions

## If Issues Persist

### For Mic Control Problems
1. Check browser console for transcript accumulation logs
2. Verify Deepgram utterance_end_ms setting in backend
3. Test with longer pauses (5+ seconds)

### For TTS Issues
1. Check browser console for voice selection logs
2. Verify selectedVoice is set to 'Matthew'
3. Check for audio permission/autoplay browser restrictions

### For Polling Issues
1. Monitor network tab for repeated API calls
2. Check if userMessageCount logic is working correctly
3. Verify polling cleanup on session changes

### For WebSocket Issues
1. Check connection manager async/await syntax
2. Verify proper cleanup in finally blocks
3. Monitor connection lifecycle in backend logs

## Success Criteria

All tests pass when:
- ‚úÖ No WebSocket errors in backend logs
- ‚úÖ Coach feedback polling only when needed  
- ‚úÖ Manual mic control works without premature sending
- ‚úÖ TTS plays automatically for all agent responses
- ‚úÖ Clean, immersive voice-first interview experience
