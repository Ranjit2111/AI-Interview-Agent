# üéØ Deepgram Filler Words Feature

## Overview

The AI Interviewer Agent now supports **filler words transcription** using Deepgram's advanced speech recognition capabilities. This feature captures natural speech patterns including "uh", "um", "ahh", and other disfluencies to provide more realistic and complete transcriptions.

## What Are Filler Words?

Filler words (also called disfluencies) are sounds or words that people naturally use when speaking:

- **"uh"** - Most common hesitation sound
- **"um"** - Thinking pause filler
- **"mhmm"** - Affirmative sound
- **"mm-mm"** - Negative sound
- **"uh-uh"** - No/disagreement
- **"uh-huh"** - Yes/agreement
- **"nuh-uh"** - Strong no/disagreement

## Why Enable Filler Words?

### üéØ **Interview Context Benefits**

1. **Natural Speech Patterns**: Captures how candidates actually speak under pressure
2. **Authenticity**: Preserves the real communication style during interviews
3. **Complete Records**: Maintains full verbatim transcripts for review
4. **Communication Assessment**: Helps evaluate speaking fluency and confidence

### üìù **Transcription Quality**

- **Before**: "I worked at Google for three years as a software engineer"
- **After**: "I, uh, worked at Google for, um, three years as a software engineer"

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Configuration

In `backend/api/speech_api.py`, Deepgram LiveOptions now includes:

```python
options = LiveOptions(
    language="en",
    model="nova-2",  # Nova models support filler words
    smart_format=True,
    interim_results=True,
    endpointing=True,
    vad_events=True,
    utterance_end_ms="1000",
    filler_words=True,  # ‚úÖ NEW: Enable filler words transcription
)
```

### Supported Filler Words

Deepgram recognizes and transcribes:

- ‚úÖ "uh"
- ‚úÖ "um"
- ‚úÖ "mhmm"
- ‚úÖ "mm-mm"
- ‚úÖ "uh-uh"
- ‚úÖ "uh-huh"
- ‚úÖ "nuh-uh"

### Model Requirements

- ‚úÖ **Nova Models**: Nova, Nova-2, Nova-3 (we use nova-2)
- ‚úÖ **English Language**: Currently English-only support
- ‚úÖ **Streaming**: Works with real-time streaming transcription
- ‚úÖ **Pre-recorded**: Also works with batch processing

## How It Works

### 1. **Speech Detection**

```
User speaks: "I have, uh, experience with, um, JavaScript programming"
```

### 2. **Real-time Processing**

- Voice Activity Detection triggers
- Interim results show: "I have uh experience with um"
- Final result shows: "I have, uh, experience with, um, JavaScript programming"

### 3. **Frontend Display**

The transcription appears in the UI with natural formatting:

- **Speaking**: Shows interim text including fillers
- **Just Added**: Shows final segment with filler words preserved
- **Building Answer**: Accumulates all segments with natural speech patterns

## User Experience

### Example Interview Scenario:

**Question**: "Tell me about your experience with React."

**Natural Response** (with filler words):

```
"Well, um, I've been working with React for, uh, about two years now. 
I, uh, started learning it at my previous job and, um, 
I've built several applications using, uh, hooks and, um, context API."
```

**Previous Behavior** (cleaned):

```
"Well I've been working with React for about two years now. 
I started learning it at my previous job and 
I've built several applications using hooks and context API."
```

**New Behavior** (with filler words):

```
"Well, um, I've been working with React for, uh, about two years now. 
I, uh, started learning it at my previous job and, um, 
I've built several applications using, uh, hooks and, um, context API."
```
