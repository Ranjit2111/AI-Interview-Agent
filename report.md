# Project Analysis Report: AI Interviewer Agent

## 1. Overview

The "AI Interviewer Agent" project is a sophisticated system designed for AI-powered job interview preparation and coaching. It utilizes a multi-agent architecture to simulate realistic interview scenarios, provide detailed feedback, assess user skills, and offer guidance for improvement. The system integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) via the LangChain framework, specifically leveraging Google Gemini, to deliver its core functionalities.

## 2. Architecture and Technology Stack

The project follows a standard web application architecture with a distinct backend and frontend.

*   **Backend:**
    *   **Framework:** Python with FastAPI.
    *   **Core Logic:** Implements the multi-agent system, API endpoints, business logic, and database interactions.
    *   **AI/LLM Integration:** Uses LangChain with Google Gemini (`gemini-pro` model) for natural language understanding, generation, and agent capabilities.
    *   **Database:** SQLite (`interview_app.db`) managed likely via SQLAlchemy or similar ORM (suggested by directory structure).
    *   **Key Libraries:** `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `langchain`, `langchain-google-genai`, `pydantic`, `python-dotenv`, `numpy`, `scipy` (for audio stubs), `PyMuPDF`, `python-docx`.
    *   **Services:** Includes stubs for Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS), with specific setup scripts for Kokoro TTS (`setup_kokoro_tts.py`), suggesting potential integration.
    *   **Structure:** Organised into modules: `api/`, `agents/`, `database/`, `models/`, `schemas/`, `services/`, `utils/`.

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Framework:** JavaScript with Next.js (React framework).
    *   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
    *   **Key Libraries:** `react`, `next`, `tailwindcss`.
    *   **Structure:** Standard Next.js project structure: `pages/`, `components/`, `styles/`, `src/`.

*   **Communication:** The frontend interacts with the backend via RESTful APIs defined in FastAPI. Agents within the backend communicate using an event-based system (`event_bus.py`).

## 3. Agents and Capabilities

The core of the system lies in its multi-agent architecture, detailed in `docs/agent_architecture.md`. Each agent has specialized responsibilities:

### 3.1. Interviewer Agent (`backend/agents/interviewer.py`)

*   **Responsibility:** Conducts the interview simulation.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   Manages interview flow using a state machine (e.g., introduction, questioning, evaluation, summary).
    *   Generates interview questions tailored to specific job roles and descriptions using LLM prompts (`backend/agents/templates/interviewer_templates.py`).
    *   Evaluates candidate answers based on predefined criteria or rubrics.
    *   Produces interview summaries and potential recommendations.

### 3.2. Coach Agent (`backend/agents/coach.py`)

*   **Responsibility:** Provides feedback and coaching to the user.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   Evaluates user responses, potentially using structured methods like the STAR technique.
    *   Assesses communication skills, clarity, and completeness of answers.
    *   Offers personalized feedback based on user context (e.g., experience level).
    *   Can generate practice questions with guidance.
    *   Uses specific prompt templates (`backend/agents/templates/coach_templates.py`).

### 3.3. Skill Assessor Agent (`backend/agents/skill_assessor.py`)

*   **Responsibility:** Identifies user skill strengths and weaknesses.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   Analyzes interview responses to map them against relevant technical and soft skills.
    *   Tracks the demonstration of specific skills throughout the interview.
    *   Identifies skill gaps.
    *   Recommends learning resources or areas for development.
    *   Provides assessments of skill proficiency levels.
    *   Uses specific prompt templates (`backend/agents/templates/skill_templates.py`).

### 3.4. Agent Orchestration

*   An `AgentOrchestrator` class (likely within `backend/services/` or `backend/agents/`) manages the interaction between agents.
*   It controls which agents are active based on the selected mode (e.g., interview only, coaching only, full feedback).
*   It composes responses from multiple agents into a cohesive output for the user.
*   It manages shared context and state across agents.

## 4. Core Features and Functionality

*   **AI Interview Simulation:** Users can engage in mock interviews driven by the Interviewer Agent.
*   **Contextual Interaction:** Users can provide context like job role, job description, and resume (`.pdf`, `.docx`) via the `/submit-context` endpoint.
*   **Personalized Feedback:** The Coach Agent provides detailed feedback on performance.
*   **Skill Gap Analysis:** The Skill Assessor Agent helps users understand their strengths and weaknesses.
*   **Audio Processing (Stubbed):** Endpoints exist (`/process-audio`, `/audio/{filename}`) for uploading audio, transcription (stubbed), and receiving audio responses (TTS, stubbed). Suggests voice interaction is a planned or partially implemented feature.
*   **Resource Management:** API endpoints exist for managing resources (`backend/api/resource_api.py`).
*   **Transcript Management:** Dedicated API routes for handling interview transcripts (`backend/api/transcript_api.py`).
*   **LLM-Powered Generation:** Uses Gemini via LangChain to generate interview questions (`/generate-interview` endpoint) and likely powers agent responses.
*   **Documentation:** Extensive documentation is available in Markdown format within the `docs/` directory and the root folder, covering setup, architecture, agents, development workflow, etc. Static API documentation generation is also mentioned (`backend/utils/docs_generator.py`).

## 5. Project Scope and Goals

The primary goal of the project is to provide a comprehensive and AI-driven platform for interview preparation. It aims to:

*   Offer realistic practice environments.
*   Deliver actionable feedback and coaching.
*   Help users identify and address skill gaps.
*   Leverage modern AI capabilities for a personalized experience.
*   Be extensible through its modular agent architecture.

## 6. Setup and Development

*   **Dependencies:** Managed via `requirements.txt` (backend) and `package.json` (frontend).
*   **Environment:** Requires Python 3.9+, Node.js/npm, and a Google Gemini API key (set via `.env` or environment variables).
*   **Running:** Involves starting the FastAPI backend server and the Next.js frontend development server separately. Helper scripts (`.bat`, `.sh`, `.ps1`) are provided for convenience.
*   **Development Workflow:** Documentation (`development_workflow.md`) exists, suggesting defined processes. The structure supports adding new agents by inheriting from `BaseAgent` and creating associated templates.

## 7. Potential Future Enhancements (from `docs/agent_architecture.md`)

*   Greater agent specialization (e.g., industry-specific interviewers).
*   Improved template management (versioning, A/B testing).
*   Enhanced orchestration (dynamic agent activation, multi-turn planning).

## 8. Conclusion

The AI Interviewer Agent is a well-structured project with a clear purpose and significant capabilities built around a multi-agent system. It leverages modern AI tools (LangChain, Gemini) and standard web technologies (FastAPI, Next.js). The extensive documentation and modular design make it a robust platform for interview preparation with potential for future expansion.
