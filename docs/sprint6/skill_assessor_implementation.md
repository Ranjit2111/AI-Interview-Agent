# Sprint 6: Skill Assessor Implementation

## Overview

The Skill Assessor agent is a specialized AI component designed to evaluate a candidate's technical and soft skills during an interview. This document outlines the implementation details, features, and usage of the Skill Assessor agent added in Sprint 6.

## Key Features

1. **Skill Extraction**: Identifies technical and soft skills mentioned or demonstrated in interview responses
2. **Proficiency Assessment**: Evaluates the candidate's proficiency level for each identified skill
3. **Skill Categorization**: Categorizes skills by type (technical, language, framework, soft skills, etc.)
4. **Resource Recommendation**: Suggests learning resources tailored to the candidate's current proficiency level
5. **Comprehensive Skill Profile**: Generates an overall assessment of the candidate's skills relative to the job role

## Architecture

The Skill Assessor implementation consists of several components:

### 1. SkillAssessorAgent Class

The `SkillAssessorAgent` extends the `BaseAgent` class and implements specialized functionality for skill assessment:

- **Skill Extraction**: Uses LLM to identify skills mentioned in interview responses
- **Proficiency Evaluation**: Assesses skill levels based on candidate statements
- **Resource Suggestion**: Provides tailored learning resources for improvement
- **Skill Profile Generation**: Creates a comprehensive overview of the candidate's skills

### 2. Data Models

The implementation extends the existing database models:

- `InterviewSession`: Added a `mode` field (INTERVIEW, COACHING, SKILL_ASSESSMENT)
- `SkillAssessment`: Stores skill evaluations with proficiency levels and feedback
- `Resource`: Tracks recommended learning resources for each skill

### 3. Event System

The Skill Assessor integrates with the event bus to communicate with other components:

- `SKILL_EXTRACTED`: Emitted when skills are identified in responses
- `SKILL_ASSESSED`: Emitted when a skill's proficiency is evaluated
- `RESOURCES_SUGGESTED`: Emitted when resources are recommended
- `SKILL_PROFILE_GENERATED`: Emitted when a comprehensive profile is created

### 4. API Endpoints

New API endpoints to expose skill assessment functionality:

- `POST /api/interview/skill-assessment`: Start a skill assessment session
- `GET /api/interview/skills`: Retrieve assessed skills for a session
- `GET /api/interview/skill-profile`: Get a comprehensive skill profile
- `GET /api/interview/skill-resources`: Get resources for improving a specific skill

## Using the Skill Assessor

### Starting a Skill Assessment

You can start a skill assessment in two ways:

1. **Creating a New Session in Skill Assessment Mode**:

```python
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/interview/skill-assessment",
    json={
        "message": "I want to assess my skills for a Software Engineer position",
        "user_id": "user_123"
    }
)
session_id = response.json()["session_id"]
```

2. **Switching an Existing Session to Skill Assessment Mode**:

```python
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/interview/skill-assessment",
    json={
        "message": "Can we switch to skill assessment?",
        "session_id": "existing_session_id",
        "user_id": "user_123"
    }
)
```

### Interacting with the Skill Assessor

Once in skill assessment mode, you can interact with the agent normally:

```python
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/interview/message",
    json={
        "message": "I have 5 years of experience with Python and JavaScript. I've worked on several web applications using React and Node.js, and I'm familiar with SQL databases.",
        "session_id": session_id
    }
)
```

### Retrieving Assessed Skills

To get a list of skills that have been assessed:

```python
response = requests.get(
    f"http://localhost:8000/api/interview/skills?session_id={session_id}"
)
skills = response.json()
```

Example response:
```json
[
  {
    "skill_name": "python",
    "category": "language",
    "proficiency_level": "advanced",
    "feedback": "Demonstrates strong Python skills with 5 years of experience"
  },
  {
    "skill_name": "javascript",
    "category": "language",
    "proficiency_level": "advanced",
    "feedback": "Shows proficiency with 5 years of JavaScript experience"
  },
  {
    "skill_name": "react",
    "category": "framework",
    "proficiency_level": "intermediate",
    "feedback": "Has practical experience with React for web applications"
  }
]
```

### Getting a Skill Profile

To generate a comprehensive skill profile:

```python
response = requests.get(
    f"http://localhost:8000/api/interview/skill-profile?session_id={session_id}"
)
profile = response.json()
```

Example response:
```json
{
  "overall_assessment": "Strong frontend developer with good backend experience as well",
  "strengths": [
    "JavaScript development",
    "Python programming",
    "Web application development"
  ],
  "areas_for_improvement": [
    "DevOps experience",
    "Cloud infrastructure knowledge"
  ],
  "recommended_learning_path": "Focus on strengthening cloud deployment skills to complement your strong development background"
}
```

### Getting Resources for Skill Improvement

To get resources for improving a specific skill:

```python
response = requests.get(
    f"http://localhost:8000/api/interview/skill-resources?skill_name=python&session_id={session_id}"
)
resources = response.json()
```

Example response:
```json
[
  {
    "type": "book",
    "title": "Fluent Python",
    "url": "https://example.com/fluent-python",
    "description": "Advanced concepts for experienced Python developers"
  },
  {
    "type": "online_course",
    "title": "Advanced Python Techniques",
    "url": "https://example.com/advanced-python-course",
    "description": "Master advanced Python features and design patterns"
  }
]
```

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual methods of the `SkillAssessorAgent`
   - `test_skill_extraction`
   - `test_proficiency_assessment`
   - `test_resource_recommendation`
   - `test_skill_profile_generation`

2. **Integration Tests**: Testing the integration with the orchestrator
   - `test_skill_assessment_mode`
   - `test_skill_extraction_event_handling`
   - `test_skill_profile_generation`

3. **API Tests**: Testing the API endpoints
   - `test_start_skill_assessment`
   - `test_get_skills`
   - `test_get_skill_profile`
   - `test_get_skill_resources`

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future sprints:

1. **Skill Visualization**: Graphical representation of skills and proficiency levels
2. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the candidate's skills with job requirements
3. **Trend Analysis**: Track skill improvement over multiple sessions
4. **Industry-Specific Skill Sets**: Specialized evaluation for different industries
5. **Skill Gap Analysis**: Identify missing skills for specific job roles

## Conclusion

The Skill Assessor agent enhances the AI Interviewer system by providing detailed skill evaluation and actionable feedback. It helps candidates understand their strengths and areas for improvement, making the interview process more valuable for skill development and career planning.
