# AI Interviewer Agent - Local Project Revision Plan

This document outlines the plan to convert the AI Interviewer Agent project to run entirely locally.

## Stage 1: Repository Cleanup and Consolidation âœ…
1. **Stop Git Tracking** âœ…
   - Remove all `.git` directories to stop tracking these repos
   - Create a fresh Git repository (optional) for the consolidated local project

2. **Folder Structure Simplification** âœ…
   - Consolidate to a simpler structure with just `frontend` and `backend` folders
   - Remove unnecessary cloud deployment files (Dockerfiles, cloud configs, etc.)

## Stage 2: Backend Consolidation and Simplification âœ…
1. **Choose and Adapt the Backend Implementation** âœ…
   - Select the cleaner backend implementation (likely the Hugging Face version)
   - Convert it to a pure FastAPI implementation (removing Gradio)
   - Remove all cloud-specific code and deployment configurations
   - Keep the Gemini Pro integration using your API key

2. **Localizing the Backend Services** âœ…
   - Configure the backend to run on localhost with a specific port
   - Ensure temporary file storage works correctly in local environment
   - Maintain all current functionality including audio processing

3. **Environment Configuration** âœ…
   - Set up a proper .env file for local configuration
   - Ensure the API key is properly loaded from local environment

## Stage 3: Frontend Adaptation âœ…
1. **Update API Endpoints** âœ…
   - Update all API calls to target localhost backend
   - Add proper error handling for local network connectivity

2. **Local Environment Compatibility** âœ…
   - Add fallbacks for browser APIs that might have permission issues in local environments
   - Ensure media access (camera, microphone) works properly with proper user prompts
   - Keep all UI elements and design as is

## Stage 4: Development Environment Setup âœ…
1. **Create a Unified Development Script** âœ…
   - Write scripts to start both frontend and backend with a single command
   - Set up proper environment variables for local development

2. **Documentation Update** âœ…
   - Create clear documentation for local setup and usage
   - Add troubleshooting guide for common local setup issues

## Stage 5: Testing and Refinement ðŸ”„
1. **Test the Local Setup** ðŸ”„
   - Verify all critical features work locally
   - Identify and address any integration issues between frontend and backend

2. **Quality Assurance** ðŸ”„
